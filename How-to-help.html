				<h4>Physical Abuse</h4>

	<p>
					In addition to this, there are children who are sexualy, physically, and emotionally torn down until they feel like they are nothing. The fact is that this is wrong.

				<p>
If you see a child demonstrating these symptoms, don't hesitate to get help. The longer a child goes being abused, the more likely that
the effects will be more drastic in the long term.
