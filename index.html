				<h3> Fact: Abuse hurts children every day </h3>
				<p> Five children<em> die </em>of abuse every day. This is five children too many, and this fact does not even encompass all of the children who are hurt untill
					they want to die, but still hang on. There are also still the kids who are not able to learn in school or make friends because of psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety 
					that happened because of constant abuse.
				</p>

			
 
            
				
				<p>
					In addition to this, there are children who are sexualy, physically, and emotionally torn down until they feel like they are nothing. The fact is that this is wrong.
				</p>

				<p>
					But we can do something to help these children. If you know someone who is abused call the child abuse hotline number. Tell somebody, so 
					the victim can get help. And maybe, you will save a life.
